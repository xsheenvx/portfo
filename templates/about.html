                  <h3>Loreto Humberto Vazquez</h3>
                  <p>
                    I was born on 1995, in brewster WA, but i grew up in Bridgeport for the first fourteen years of my life.
                    After moving to Cashmere I went to highschool untill the eleventh grade and got my GED at Wenatchee Valley College.
                    After a year hiatus I went to college there and tried to find my passion. Unable to focus and find my
                    passion I decided to join the working force. 
                  </p>
                  <h3>Loreto the worker Bee</h3>
                  <p>
                    I tried my hand at just about every job I could get, from landscaping and construction to fruit sorting and operating 
                    machines in packing sheds. My best experince was at a place called H2Precast; there I found therapeutic activites such
                    as loosening bolts and patching up concrete. Had a great time untill one day I was at work and realized I was just waisting
                    my time working for people who wouldn't care whether or not it was me doing the job or not. So with that I went back to 
                    pursuing my passion, and found it after some time.. programming! 
                  </p>
                  <h3>Loreto, Programmer extraordinaire!</h3>
                  <p>
                    Remembering my passion of when I was a kid, I decided to start on my path of building my AI. I started by finding anywhere
                    I could learn to code for free, I tried my hand at CodeAcademy for a good while, about a half a year. After learning a decent
                    amount of HTML, CSS and Javascript, I decided to see if someone would give me a piece of paper saying I could code, that way I
                    could get an easy foot in the door and not start at the bottom. realizing I have enough debt I decided I'd go about earning my
                    way in instead. 
                  </p>
                  <h3>Loreto, the Student</h3>
                  <p>
                    Now I'm here at Udemy; after getting a good grasp at HTML, CSS, and Javascript from Colt Steele, I'm now learning Python
                    as a pre req to machine learning and I'm having a great time. Feel free to follow me on my journey and support me on my
                    Patreon(its a joke of the times). If you got here to hire me I'm more than happy to get a good couple years experience at your institution;
                    if your here to get to know the man, just contact me on my cantact page. Always ready to help and eager to learn!
                  </p>
